Tree-based Regression:

Pros: Fits complex, nonlinear data
Cons: Difficult to interpret results
Works with: Numeric values, nominal values

Prepruning and Postpruning
1)postpruning uses a test set to prune the tree. It's a more idealistic 
method of pruning because it doesn't use any user-defined parameters.
2)postpruning isn't as effective as prepruning

Model Trees:
interpretable
higher accuracy
