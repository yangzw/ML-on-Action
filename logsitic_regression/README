Logistic regression:

Pros: Computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, knowledge representation easy to interpret
Cons: Prone to underfitting, may have low accuracy

For the logistic regression classifier we’ll take our features and multiply each one
by a weight and then add them up. This result will be put into the sigmoid, and we’ll
get a number between 0 and 1. Anything above 0.5 we’ll classify as a 1, and anything
below  0.5  we’ll  classify  as  a  0.

find the best regression coefficients:
Gradient ascent:
If we want to find the maximum point on a function, then the best way to move is in the direction of the gradient
alpha: step
Pseudocode:
 Start with the weights all set to 1
 Repeat R number of times:
 	Calculate the gradient of the entire dataset
 	Update the weights vector by alpha*gradient (W := W + alpha*gradient)
 return the weights vector

Stochastic Gradient Ascent:
Start with the weights all set to 1
For each piece in the dataset:
	calculate the gradient of one piece of data
	update the weights vector by alpha*gradient
Return the weight vector

Logistic regression is finding best-fit parameters to a nonlinear function called the sigmoid.
Methods of optimization can be used to find the best-fit parameters. 
Among the optimization algorithms, one of the most common algorithms is gradient ascent. 
Gradient ascent can be simplified with stochastic gradient ascent. 
Stochastic gradient ascent can do as well as gradient ascent using far fewer computing  resources.  
In addition,  stochastic  gradient  ascent  is  an  online  algorithm;
it can update what it has learned as new data comes in rather than reloading all of the data
as in batch processing.
